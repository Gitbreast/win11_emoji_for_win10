# win11_emoji_for_win10
Use Win11's emojis to replace Win10's! The emojis in Win10 are too little for me!

Simple CMD to apply `seguiemj.ttf` of Win11 for Win10.

Run the `install.cmd` to apply v1.45, the newest version extracted from Win11_23H2.

Run the `uninstall.cmd` to apply v1.29, the original version of Win10.

**Just double-click to run, there is no need to run as admin.**
